What does it do?
----------------------
NOTE: YOU will need to change the (Item_Under_Mouse =) address with a one that works/its different for you so my address WILL NOT work for you!
Also make sure that you edit these 2 words/items inside of the " " 
IF (QQ = "Attacking Spar" or QQ = "Defensive Spar")
These are the items that the bot will pick up if it gets dropped.

This bot will ONLY work if you are a Summoner class because it uses the (Ghostly Puppet) to auto mark/select an Enemy and then switch the Puppet into Aggressive mode/Auto attack mode, then when the Enemy is killed it will check for a specific item/loot that the Enemy drooped and pick it up and continue to do that/loop it all again.
