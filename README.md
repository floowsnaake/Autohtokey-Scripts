#What does it do?
----------------------

#NOTE: YOU will need to change the (Under_Mouse =) adress with a one that works/its diffirent for you so miy adress WILL NOT work for you!

Also make sure that you edit these 2 words/items inside of the " " 

IF (QQ = "Attacking Spar" or QQ = "Defensive Spar")

These are the items that the bot will pick up if it gets dropped.

This bot will ONL work if you are a Summoner class becuse it uses the (Ghostly Puppet) to auto mark/select an Enemy and then switch the Puppet into Agressive mode/Auto attack mode, then when the Enemy is killed it will check for a specific item/loot that the Enemy droped and pick it up and continue to do that/loop it all again.
